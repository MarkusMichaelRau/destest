# destest

I'm currently migrating my SV code to this repository and cleaning it up along the way. Not everything has been migrated, and some may be buggy.

Currently, the shear tests in the main testsuite.py should work.

Non-standard python packages used: fitsio, pandas, healpy, astropy.table, mpi4py, treecorr, esutil, scipy.optimize, sklearn.linear_model, easyaccess, meds, desdb.

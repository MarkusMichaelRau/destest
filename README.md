# destest

I'm currently migrating my SV code to this repository and cleaning it up along the way. Not everything has been migrated, and some things may not be user-friendly. This is about 90% complete.

Currently, the shear tests in the main testsuite.py should work as-is. 

Python packages used in some places that you may not have by default: fitsio, pandas, healpy, astropy.table, mpi4py, treecorr, esutil, scipy.optimize, sklearn.linear_model, easyaccess, meds, desdb.

In general, the code will work for basic things without most of these.
